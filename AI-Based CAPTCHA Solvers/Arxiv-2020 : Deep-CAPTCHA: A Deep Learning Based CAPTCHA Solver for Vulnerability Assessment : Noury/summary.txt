ðŸ“‘ Summary

Methodology

The authors propose Deep-CAPTCHA, a customized deep learning framework to analyze and break text-based CAPTCHAs. Their approach combines:
	â€¢	Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with three convolutionalâ€“max pooling pairs followed by a dense layer and multiple Softmax layers.
	â€¢	Pre-processing: image resizing, grayscale conversion, and median filter noise reduction.
	â€¢	Output encoding: Instead of a single classifier, multiple Softmax layers were used to improve accuracy across different CAPTCHA character positions.
	â€¢	Optimizer: Adam optimizer was selected for faster and more stable convergence compared to SGD ï¿¼.

Steps
	1.	Dataset generation â€“ Created 500,000 synthetic CAPTCHA samples using Pythonâ€™s ImageCaptcha library.
	2.	Pre-processing â€“ Reduced resolution (135Ã—50 â†’ 67Ã—25), grayscale conversion, and noise reduction via median filtering.
	3.	Network design â€“ Three CNN layers with ReLU activations, max pooling, dropout regularization, dense layer, and multiple Softmax classifiers for each character position.
	4.	Training â€“ Trained for 50 epochs with batch size 128 on numerical and alphanumerical CAPTCHAs.
	5.	Evaluation â€“ Conducted extensive testing (another 500,000 samples) to assess recognition accuracy, error patterns, and weaknesses.
	6.	Vulnerability analysis â€“ Analyzed misclassified CAPTCHAs and identified design weaknesses that could make CAPTCHAs more resilient ï¿¼.

Results
	â€¢	Achieved 98.94% accuracy on numerical CAPTCHAs and 98.31% on alphanumerical CAPTCHAs.
	â€¢	Significantly outperformed segmentation-based solvers and older CNN approaches.
	â€¢	Identified vulnerabilities in CAPTCHA design:
	â€¢	Digits 3, 7, 8, 9 and certain letters (w, v, m, n) cause higher misclassification rates.
	â€¢	Rotations above 10â€“20Â° increase solver failure.
	â€¢	Low grayscale intensity CAPTCHAs were easier for machines but harder for humans.
	â€¢	Suggested improvements: use brighter alphanumeric characters, confusing rotations, and close-proximity letters to strengthen CAPTCHA schemes
