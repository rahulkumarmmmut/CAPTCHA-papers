Methodology

The authors introduced Yet Another Text Captcha Solver (YATCS), a flexible framework designed to break diverse text-based CAPTCHA schemes. Their methodology relied on:
	â€¢	Pre-processing: Removing noise, normalizing image size, and enhancing contrast.
	â€¢	Segmentation-free recognition: Instead of splitting CAPTCHA characters explicitly, the system uses Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to recognize character sequences directly.
	â€¢	Training with labeled data: Building statistical models from large datasets of labeled CAPTCHA samples.

Steps
	1.	Data collection â€“ Gathered thousands of CAPTCHA samples from real-world deployments (e.g., reCAPTCHA, BotDetect, Asirra).
	2.	Pre-processing â€“ Applied noise reduction, binarization, and affine normalization to prepare images for recognition.
	3.	Feature extraction â€“ Used sliding-window features such as pixel densities and edge orientations.
	4.	Model training â€“ Trained HMMs on labeled character data to learn probabilistic transitions between characters.
	5.	Sequence decoding â€“ Applied the Viterbi algorithm to find the most likely text sequence for each CAPTCHA.
	6.	Evaluation â€“ Benchmarked against state-of-the-art solvers to compare success rates and efficiency.

Results
	â€¢	YATCS achieved high success rates on multiple real-world CAPTCHA schemes, outperforming rule-based and segmentation-dependent solvers.
	â€¢	Demonstrated resilience against obfuscation techniques like background clutter, distortion, and overlapping characters.
	â€¢	Highlighted that segmentation-free approaches generalize better across different CAPTCHA types.
	â€¢	Suggested that many widely deployed text CAPTCHAs were already at risk of being broken using statistical learning models.
