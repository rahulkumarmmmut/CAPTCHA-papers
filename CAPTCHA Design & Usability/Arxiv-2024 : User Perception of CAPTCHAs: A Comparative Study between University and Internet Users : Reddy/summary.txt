ðŸ“‘ Summary

Methodology

The authors conducted a comparative survey-based study to evaluate user perceptions of CAPTCHA usability and security. They recruited 259 participants from two distinct groups:
	â€¢	Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) users with diverse demographics.
	â€¢	University computer science students with technical backgrounds.

A 23-question survey was designed and deployed using Qualtrics, focusing on CAPTCHA types, usability issues, accessibility, frustration, and overall security perceptions. Both quantitative (Likert scale, ANOVA, chi-squared) and qualitative (open-ended feedback, thematic coding) analyses were applied ï¿¼.

Steps
	1.	Recruitment â€“ 154 MTurk participants (150 valid), 109 university students (all valid).
	2.	Survey design â€“ Collected demographics, prior CAPTCHA experience, usability issues, device usage, accessibility challenges, and opinions on CAPTCHA effectiveness.
	3.	Usability evaluation â€“ Analyzed user-reported difficulties (distortion, size/shape, unclear instructions, case sensitivity, small-screen issues).
	4.	Security perceptions â€“ Asked whether CAPTCHAs are effective at distinguishing bots and whether they can withstand modern attacks.
	5.	Comparative analysis â€“ Compared MTurk vs. university responses to test six null hypotheses (differences in preference, difficulty perception, usability, security, abandonment rates, and overall stance).
	6.	Statistical validation â€“ Applied ANOVA and chi-squared tests to confirm significant differences between groups ï¿¼.

Results
	â€¢	Usability challenges:
	â€¢	Distortion and unclear text/images were the top causes of failures.
	â€¢	Users often failed on the first attempt and had to retry, with many reporting frustration.
	â€¢	Small-screen devices (phones, tablets) worsened usability due to orientation, screen size, and input issues.
	â€¢	Abandonment trends:
	â€¢	65% of MTurk users admitted to leaving a page when faced with difficult CAPTCHAs, compared to 25% of university students, who showed greater persistence.
	â€¢	CAPTCHA preferences:
	â€¢	Image recognition CAPTCHAs were most common, while text CAPTCHAs remained popular.
	â€¢	MTurk users preferred text-based CAPTCHAs, while university students leaned toward image recognition.
	â€¢	Security perception:
	â€¢	MTurk users generally trusted CAPTCHAs more (64% considering them secure), while university students were more skeptical (only 44%).
	â€¢	Many respondents doubted that CAPTCHAs could keep up with advancing attacks.
	â€¢	Final stance: Most participants found CAPTCHAs either usable but insecure or secure but not user-friendly, highlighting a persistent securityâ€“usability tradeoff
