Methodology

Proposes a Proof-of-Work (PoW) CAPTCHA that replaces image/text challenges with a client-side cryptographic puzzle. Unlike classic PoW (exact nonce), this scheme defines a range-target‚Äîthe server issues a hash function plus starting_point, lower_target, and upper_target. Users iterate from the starting point, hash, and submit any value whose hash falls within the target range. Crucially, the computation is repurposed to brute-force password hashes stored server-side, so solving CAPTCHAs contributes to password-cracking tasks (e.g., for law-enforcement use). Difficulty is tuned by narrowing the target range; server verification is O(1) (single hash + bounds check).  Ôøº

Steps
	1.	Puzzle issuance ‚Äî Server returns {hash_type, starting_point, lower_target, upper_target, token}.  Ôøº
	2.	Client solve ‚Äî Increment from starting_point, compute hashes, stop when the hash prefix (n bits) lies between the bounds.  Ôøº
	3.	Submission & verification ‚Äî Client sends {token, value}; server re-hashes once, checks bounds, enforces expiry, and confirms value ‚â• starting_point.  Ôøº
	4.	Work accounting ‚Äî Server estimates expected work
      x = 2^{(n-1)}/(\text{upper}-\text{lower}) and compares to implied hashes value - starting_point to flag anomalies (still accept, but exclude from next starting point selection).  Ôøº
	5.	Batch consensus for progress ‚Äî To advance coverage over the keyspace, serve the same puzzle to a small batch; when ‚â•51% agree on a solution, set the next batch‚Äôs starting_point = prev_solution + 1.  Ôøº
	6.	Difficulty & policy ‚Äî Adjust bounds per risk signals; discuss related PoW/anti-abuse systems (Hashcash, CoinHive, Cloudflare Turnstile).  Ôøº

Results
	‚Ä¢	Concept evaluation (no full system benchmarks): argues UX benefits (no user interaction), ML-resistance (best strategy is brute-force), and ‚Äúuseful work‚Äù (hash-cracking) vs. wasteful PoW. Acknowledges threats: electricity-cost arbitrage, FPGA/ASIC/botnet acceleration, and cryptojacking risks; positions security as comparable to modern CAPTCHAs and recommends dynamic difficulty + environment signals.
